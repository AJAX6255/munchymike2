# Battlesnake FALL 2021 NodeJS AI
![Battlesnake 2021](./static/logo.png)

This is my entry for [Battlesnake](https://www.battlesnake.io) 2021 Fall competition, and is my first attempt at at generating one in NodeJS.

Forked from the great work of Tyrel Hiebert (https://github.com/tyrelh/battlesnake2020).
Who built his snakes from [NodeJS starter snake](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/starter-snake-node) provided by the [Battlesnake community](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/community).

## Running the snake locally
Follow the directions given on the [Battlesnake Docs](http://docs.battlesnake.io/zero-to-snake-linux.html) in the Zero to Snake section for your operating system. When you get to the point where it tells you to clone the starter snake, you can clone this snake instead if you wish.
```shell
git clone git://github.com/AJAX6255/BattleSnakeFall2021.git
```
You can also deploy this repo directly to Heroku by clicking this link. You will need a Heroku account to do this.
